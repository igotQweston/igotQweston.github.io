So, recently there's been a lot of talk in the maimai twitter (now x) community about a certain video that's been making the rounds. It's a video of a player playing a song in maimai, and the player is... well, let's just say they're not exactly playing the game the way it was intended to be played.

***Be warned!! The video is a bit NSFW, so I put it behind a spoiler. If you're not comfortable with that kind of content, please don't click on it.***

The video in question shows a player playing a song in maimai with questionable background video of Mutsuki from Blue Archive, using a... rather unconventional method. Instead of using their hand or upper limbs (if it's an utage chart), they're using their crotch. Yes, you read that right. They're playing the game with their fucking crotch.

While some people find the video amusing, most of the community doesn't seem to share the same sentiment. Many are just shocked, some are disgusted, personally I think it's hilarious. But the general consensus is that it's not something that should be encouraged or celebrated and I agree. This is supposed to be a fun and accessible game that should be enjoyed by everyone, not a horny one.

According to some commenter, this video was leaked from a private group chat and propagated to twitter (now x). As this was supposed to be an inside joke taken a bit too far than the general community is comfortable with, I can see why this is met with contempt by the community. As it kinda tarnished the image of the community as a degenerates who play anime rhythm games. 

As someone who is a part of both the maimai and the Blue Archive community, this incident is just very amusing to me and a bit of a surprise. Never in live have I ever thought that I would see a maimai cropped porn chart of Mutsuki from Blue Archive being played by humping the machine. While I've seen some cropped porn charts on games like osu!. I never thought that I would see a version of it in maimai. It's just so absurd and funny to me.

Either way this event will ultimately become yet another filter of the tourist for the Blue Archive community. The video was shared on twitter (now x) and it was met controversy. Some people were laughing, some were disgusted, and some were just confused. But we all can agree that it is not something that should be encouraged to be done in public. If you want to do it with a private cab, then go ahead. But don't do it in public. Overall, it became a big win for the cunnychad senseis of Blue Archive. As they continuously gatekeep tourist from entering their sacred place. But sometimes you see some senseis being degenerates in other communities.\
Using the wise words from the great dorontabi: *`"Damn bruaka Sensei! Being horny in maimai. Correction needed💢💢💢"`*
