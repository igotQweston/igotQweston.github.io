A desktop Electron app for viewing and translating [ShinyColors Enza](https://shinycolors.enza.fun/) via userscript injection of [Shiny Colors English Patch](https://github.com/snowyivu/ShinyColors).

> **Note:** This project was initially created as a proof of concept, inspired by KanColle viewers like [poi](https://poi.moe/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/poooi/poi)), to explore providing a similar experience for Shiny Colors.

How it works:
- Loads the game in a `<webview>` with a preload script.
- The preload script injects the userscript into the page as early as possible.
- The main process fetches the latest userscript from GitHub.
