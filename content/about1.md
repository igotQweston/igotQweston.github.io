## About Me

Hey! My name is Fawkes, but you might also know me as igotQweston. I'm a hobbyist programmer who loves to tinker with different languages. I code in Python, JS, and Go. You can check out some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/igotQweston).\
I also use Arch btw.

I'm an audiophile with a special interest in budget Chi-Fi IEMs. Especially the $100 range and the very competitive $20 range. I'm always on the lookout for the next best IEM for the price. My current favorite and daily driver is the TRUTHEAR HEXA.

I'm a huge fan of rhythm games. I've been playing them for years and I'm always looking for new ones to try. I'm currently playing a lot of MaiMai DX Buddies. Used to play a lot of osu! but I've since moved to other games. Other rhythm games I play include Etterna, ADOFAI, ProSekai, Quaver, Rotaeno, and more. As much as I want to play bemani games or any other arcade rhythm games, I can't because my country has a very limited selection of rhythm games especially bemani games and other non SEGA japanese rhythm games.

Just like any good programmer and linux user, I love anime. Though I don't watch as much anime as I used to, I still enjoy watching a good anime every now and then. I'm a huge fan of the Monogatari series. I also enjoy reading manga and dabble in some light novels and visual novels. Though I'm currently addicted to thrashy isekai manga. I can't stop reading them. It's like eating instant noodles. It's bad for you but you can't stop eating them. But I'm also a fan of good isekai manga like Mushoku Tensei, Eminence in Shadow, and Youjo Senki. Outside of isekai, I also enjoy Blue Period, March Comes in Like a Lion, Sousou no Frieren, D-Frag, The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You, and more.
